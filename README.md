# Sophie
A [sophisticated copyright linter](https://github.com/aws/s2n-tls/issues/4078#issuecomment-1707031744) implemented as a portable UNIX shell script.

## Overview
Sophie handles your copyright header compliance checks by parsing a human-readable configuration file. This means you can make simple to complex tests of your custom or industry legal standards across your project as easy as defining patterns and making statements. Sophie can operate with minute details to ensure precise placement/structure of copyright notices, and defensively, leaving no room for any un-acknowledged intellectual property in your code.
